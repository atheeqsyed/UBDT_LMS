# Project Name: **Lecture Upload and Management System**

## Overview
This project is designed to allow users to **upload, manage, and download lectures** in a web application. The platform enables users to interact with lecture materials through an intuitive UI built with **React**, while the backend, powered by **Laravel**, handles file storage, authentication, and database interactions.

The final system will provide the following:
- User authentication for secure access
- Upload of lecture materials (e.g., PDFs, videos)
- Retrieval and download of lecture files
- Manage lectures in a structured way (e.g., lecture name, file type, etc.)
- A simple UI for users to browse and access lecture materials

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Laravel 9.x**: PHP framework for handling the server-side logic, including authentication, database management, and routing.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing lecture information and user details.
- **Laravel Blade**: Templating engine for rendering HTML views on the frontend.
- **File Storage**: Laravel’s built-in file handling (local or cloud storage like S3).

### Frontend:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the UI components that will interact with the backend via APIs.
- **Vite**: A modern, fast development server and bundler for React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend.

### Development Tools:
- **Composer**: Dependency management for PHP.
- **npm/yarn**: Dependency management for JavaScript.
- **Docker**: (optional) For containerization of the application, ensuring the development environment is consistent across machines.

## Features & Functionalities
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/logout functionality with session management.
- **Lecture Upload**: Users can upload lecture files, which are stored on the server or cloud storage.
- **Lecture Management**: Ability to create, view, edit, and delete lectures.
- **Lecture Display**: List lectures in an organized manner and allow users to download them.
- **Search & Filter**: Ability to search and filter lectures based on attributes like lecture name, category, etc.

## Local Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies (Laravel):
Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed. Then, navigate to the backend directory and run the following commands:
# Install Laravel backend dependencies
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

# Set up environment variables and generate the application key
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Run database migrations to create the necessary tables
php artisan migrate

# Set up file storage
php artisan storage:link


### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies (React):
Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed. Then, navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
cd frontend

# Install React and other frontend dependencies
npm install

# Run the React development server
npm run dev


### 4. Run the Application:
Start the Laravel backend server:
php artisan serve


Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

For the React frontend, if running on a different port, open the application at http://localhost:3000.

### Database Configuration:
Make sure your .env file has the correct database settings:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=


Once configured, run the migrations to set up the database tables:

php artisan migrate

You can also seed the database with sample data (optional):

php artisan db:seed


### Sample Data:
If you want to populate your database with sample data, you can run the following command:

php artisan db:seed
This will insert the predefined sample data into your database.


### Expected Output:
Backend: The Laravel backend should be running on http://localhost:8000.
Frontend: The React application should be running on http://localhost:3000.
Ensure there are no errors during installation or when starting the application.


### Final Output:
Once everything is set up correctly, you should have a working application with:

A Laravel-powered backend serving API requests.
A React frontend that communicates with the Laravel API.
You can now begin working on the features and functionalities required for the project.


### Project Structure:
Here’s an overview of the project structure:

### Future Improvements:
Authentication: Implement OAuth or JWT-based authentication for the API.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests for both the frontend and backend.
CI/CD: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
UI/UX Improvements: Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive user experience.
Performance Optimization: Improve performance with caching, lazy loading, etc.
